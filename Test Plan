1. Objectives
Verify core gameplay functionality: game start, play, scoring, and game over conditions.
Ensure UI elements (score display, hit zone, game state screens) function correctly.
Confirm local storage properly handles and updates high scores.
Validate responsiveness and basic animation smoothness.

2. Test Scope
In Scope:
Functional testing of gameplay mechanics and scoring.
UI/UX behavior during different game states.
Edge case handling (e.g., rapid or off-target taps).
Local storage data persistence across sessions.

Out of Scope:
Server-side testing (no server communication involved).
Deep performance profiling (e.g., memory leaks, FPS benchmarks).
Cross-platform testing on mobile (for this phase).

3. Test Items
Game start and restart behavior
Gameplay scoring logic and hit detection
Game over triggers (miss tap detection)
UI elements (score, animations, state changes)
High score saving via localStorage
Responsiveness on varying screen sizes

4. Test Strategy
Manual testing of game flows and edge cases
Repeated test cycles on:
Desktop: Chrome (latest), Firefox (latest)
Exploratory testing for unexpected user behaviors
Bug logging and regression checks

5. Test Deliverables
Test cases (executed and tracked)
Bug reports (with reproduction steps)

Recommendations for release
This Test Plan document

6. Test Environment
Desktop browsers:
Google Chrome (vXX)
Mozilla Firefox (vXX)
Screen resolutions tested: 1366×768, 1920×1080
Local storage enabled

7. Exit Criteria
All critical and major test cases pass
No open high-severity defects
Known minor issues are documented
Final test summary is approved

8. Risks & Mitigations
Risk	Mitigation
Tap miss detection bug affects game over logic	Logged; to be fixed in next sprint
High score may not save on abrupt tab close	Add beforeunload event handling
Limited device/browser coverage	Plan additional testing for mobile later
