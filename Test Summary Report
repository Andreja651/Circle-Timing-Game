Project: Reflex - Circle Timing Game
Tester: Andreja Mihajlovski
Date: 2025-07-30

1. Objectives
• Verify core gameplay functionality: start, play, score, and game over conditions.
• Ensure UI elements (score, hit zone, game states) behave as expected.
• Confirm local storage correctly tracks and updates high score.
• Validate responsiveness and basic animations.

2. Testing Scope
• Functional tests on gameplay mechanics and UI feedback.
• Edge cases like tapping outside the hit zone or rapid tapping.
• Persistence of high score data across sessions.

3. Summary of Tests
Test Area                   Total Cases       Passed        Failed         Comments
Game Start & Restart        2                 2             0              All start/restart flows work correctly.
Gameplay & Scoring          3                 3             0              Score increments and speed increase work fine.
Tap Handling (Positive)     3                 3             0              Correct hit detection and scoring.
Tap Handling (Negative)     2                 1             1              One intermittent issue with miss tap detection (see bugs).
UI & Animations             2                 2             0              Smooth animations and visuals.
Data Persistence            2                 1             1              High score persistence mostly works; some issues on abrupt tab close.

4. Overall Assessment
The core gameplay and UI functionality are stable and meet the project requirements. Minor bugs affecting tap miss detection and high score persistence were identified and logged for fixing.

5. Recommendations
• Fix intermittent tap miss detection to ensure consistent game over triggers.
• Improve localStorage handling to save high scores reliably on abrupt tab closure.
• Test UI responsiveness on various devices to resolve minor layout issues.
